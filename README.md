# Turner Bio
I was born in 1948 in New Orleans, LA and grew up in the French Quarter, raised by "show business parents."
As a young man, I heavily considered becoming a priest, but became an art student instead.
In the 1970s, I moved to Los Angeles where I developed a keen interest in fitness. 
I opened a salad bar called Ruffage, which was later renamed to "Slimmons" which also taught aerobics classes throughout the week.
I then pursued a very illustrious career in media appearing on General Hospital, Whose Line is it Anyway?, Saturday Night Live and my magnum opus: Sweatin' to the Oldies.
